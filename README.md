# Simon Game

## 🎮 About the Project

This project is a recreation of the classic short-term memory game, **Simon**. Developed as a fun mini-project, it aims to enhance skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game tests your memory by requiring you to replicate a sequence of lights and sounds.

## 🚀 How It Works

In the **Simon Game**, you'll see a sequence of colored buttons light up and hear corresponding beeps. Each round, the sequence grows longer, adding a new color and sound to the pattern. Your goal is to repeat the sequence correctly. The game ends when you make an incorrect move.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the game elements.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, including sequence generation and user input handling.

## 🎨 Features

- **Memory Challenge**: Improve your short-term memory by repeating sequences.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: Each round adds a new step to the sequence.
- **Sound Effects**: Audio cues for each button press and sequence step.
- **Visual Indicators**: Colorful buttons that light up to indicate the sequence.
