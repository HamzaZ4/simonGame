# Simon Game

## About the Project
This project is a recreation of the classic short-term memory game, **Simon**. I built it as a fun mini-project to enhance my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## How It Works
The **Simon Game** challenges your memory by lighting up buttons in a sequence. Each round adds a new beep to the pattern, and it's your job to repeat the sequence correctly. The game continues until you make a mistake!
